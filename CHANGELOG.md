## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-19s

### Changed

- Added Docker Compose setup instructions to the README

### Dependencies

- Updated frontend npm dependencies
- Updated backend Python dependencies


## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Migrated and split Renovate configuration by package manager

### Dependencies

- Updated `pnpm` to v10.33.4
- Updated npm, Python, and GitHub Actions dependencies


## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-13

### Security

- Bumped `cryptography` in the backend (46.0.3 → 46.0.7) to stay on the latest patch line from the dependency graph.
- Added pnpm overrides in `frontend/` for `seroval`, `seroval-plugins`, and `picomatch`, pinning transitive versions that were flagged in audits so the lockfile resolves to patched releases.

### Changed

- Consolidated the dev container setup: one `Dockerfile.dev`, a single root `devcontainer.json`, and a slimmer `docker-compose` instead of separate backend, docs, and frontend devcontainer stacks.
- Refreshed `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.vscode/settings.json` to match the unified dev environment.

### Dependencies

**`backend/`**

- `cryptography` 46.0.3 → 46.0.7

**`frontend/`**

- pnpm overrides: `seroval` ^1.4.1, `seroval-plugins` ^1.4.1, `picomatch` ^4.0.4 (with lockfile updates; e.g. `seroval-plugins` resolves to 1.5.4)
- Related lockfile deduplication for `picomatch` and the seroval toolchain

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-12

### Security

- Bumped the Dependabot `npm_and_yarn` dependency group in `docs/` and `frontend/` to pull in current patch and minor releases across the toolchain (build, parsing, and HTTP stack), reducing exposure to known issues in older transitive versions.
